* [ ] Process the photos, correct exposure, perspective distortion, and adjust
      the type area.

* [x] Run OCR (optical character recognition) on the binary images.
* [x] Create PDF book of the original book from the binary images and the OCR
      results.
* [ ] Organize each recipe in the book with an abstract data structure, and
	  save them with an open-standard file format, say JSON (JavaScript Object
      Notation).
* [ ] Write program to compile the JSON data to LaTeX documents.
* [ ] Reproduce the appearance of the original book with LaTeX typesetting.
* [ ] Render LaTeX documents and create PDF book.
