*Sichuan Cookbook* (四川菜谱) is a renowned classic, first published in July
1972 by Chengdu Catering Company (成都市饮食公司). It contains 312 traditional
recipes, many of which are no longer served in modern restaurants. The aim of
this project is to digitize the *Sichuan Cookbook* correctly, preserving its
rich culinary history.

* [x] Photograph each page of the book using a digital camera.
* [x] Enhance the photos, correcting exposure and perspective distortion, and
      adjust the typographical area.
* [x] Convert the enhanced photos into binary images.
* [x] Perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on the binary images.
* [x] Generate a PDF of the original book from the binary images and the OCR
      results.
* [x] Abstract each recipe into a data structure and document them in
      $\mathrm{L\kern-.36em\lower-.428571ex\hbox{\small{A}}\kern-.15emT\kern-.1667em\lower.5ex\hbox{E}\kern-.125emX}$.
* [x] Replicate the original book's appearance using
      $\mathrm{L\kern-.36em\lower-.428571ex\hbox{\small{A}}\kern-.15emT\kern-.1667em\lower.5ex\hbox{E}\kern-.125emX}$
      typesetting.
* [x] Compile the
      $\mathrm{L\kern-.36em\lower-.428571ex\hbox{\small{A}}\kern-.15emT\kern-.1667em\lower.5ex\hbox{E}\kern-.125emX}$
      documents to create a final PDF version.
* [x] Optionally, annotate the book with additional research findings.

### Operating System Selection

Preferred operating systems are Debian or Ubuntu, though other Linux
distributions are compatible. Apple macOS is also suitable if necessary
command-line tools are installed.

## Digitizing the Book

### Remastered Digital Version

* Each book page was photographed with a digital camera and processed with
  Adobe Lightroom Classic for RAW decoding, perspective distortion correction,
  and other minor adjustments.
* To avoid bloating the git repository, all JPEG photos are hosted on
  ``user-images.githubusercontent.com``. Download all JPEG photos
  <sub>(625 MiB)</sub> using the following command:
  ```
  make -C jpeg
  ```
* Alternatively, download all JPEG files in a single tarball from
  [here](https://github.com/neo954/sichuan-cookbook/releases/download/v0.0.3-pre-alpha/sichuan-cookbook-1972.jpeg.tar)
  <sub>(625 MB)</sub>.

#### Prerequisites for Image Processing

* The original book's dimensions (185mm x 130mm) are maintained, corresponding
  to an aspect ratio of approximately √2:1.
* For 600dpi resolution, the digital image size should be 4370px x 3091px.
* All JPEG photos are processed with ImageMagick and performed OCR with
  Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine.
  ```
  sudo apt-get install imagemagick tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-chi-sim
  ```

#### Compilation Instructions

* Compile the processed images into a PDF using the following commands:
  ```
  make -C jpeg
  make scan
  ```

### LaTeX Remake of the Book
