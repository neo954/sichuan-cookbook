\begin{recipe}{旱蒸全鸡}

\ingredients

\ingredient{活鸡一只}{约三斤}
\ingredient{醪糟浮子}{一两}
\ingredient{盐}{三钱}
\ingredient{花椒}{数粒}
\ingredient{葱白}{二钱}
\ingredient{姜}{一钱}
\ingredient{生鸡油}{一两}

\preparation

\step 杀鸡、去毛、去脏腹、去足爪，出一水，将血水提净，除净细毛，全身抹盐和醪糟
浮子；加葱、姜、花椒、生鸡油等，用大鱼碗盛起。

\step 用小木甑一个，将箅子翻转垫平；锅内将水烧沸，木甑放上，鸡碗置甑内；再用尖
底瓦盆一个，盛清水放木甑上作盖，甑口处用湿布帕密封；用中武火使水保持沸度；由于
密封热气不易散发，水蒸汽上升到盆底结成水珠，滴于碗内成汤汁；约三小时鸡𤆵出甑，
翻入深边圆盘，连原汁蒸汤上席。

\features

鲜香、肥嫩、原汁原味、极富营养。
