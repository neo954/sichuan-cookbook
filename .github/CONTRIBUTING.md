## Proofreading

For each receipt under the `latex` directory, proofreading is needed. If you
want to help to proofread, please claim the unassigned working items from
[GitHub
issues](https://github.com/neo954/sichuan-cookbook/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+Proofread+sort%3Acreated-asc+no%3Aassignee).

This [A4 paper size scanned copy for
printing](https://github.com/neo954/sichuan-cookbook/releases/download/v0.0.3-alpha/sichuan-cookbook-1972-proof-a4.pdf)
<sub>(80.6 MB)</sub> is recommended to be used for proofreading.

Please report typos of a receipt with a new comment on the same issue page you
claimed. Of course, pull requests are always welcome!
